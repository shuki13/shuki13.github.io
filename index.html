                            During my time at the DawgBytes Leadership in Tech Camp, I learned a lot about leadership skills in the tech industry, including topics like quality feedback, complex projects, difficult people, stepping up, mentorship, and many more. We also had guest speakers, Lilian Liang, Martha Arellano, and Mina Markham, who came in and talked about their experience in tech and the leadership skills they’ve gained that they thought were important.

            <p align="left" style="font-family:calibri;color:#3B3A7A;font-size:110%;">

                            I learned that communication is important. I should always reach out if I am interested in something, and I should be open about the good and bad things like successes and struggles. It is hard to feel confident when you have the Imposter Syndrome, which is when you feel like your success is by chance and you don’t feel like you deserve to be where you are. To deal with it, talk to people about it and fake it till you make it. Also, it is important to make friends; to find a support group who you can relate to and which will act as a support system for you. Another important thing Lilian mentioned was to take advantage of all the opportunities available to you including, high school internships, college internships, scholarships, and many other amazing opportunities.

            <p align="left" style="font-family:calibri;color:#3B3A7A;font-size:110%;">

                            Martha taught us a lot about lessons she learned about leadership in tech. She told us that in the tech industry or any industry in general there will always be opportunities for you to step into a leadership role. Communication is very important in getting the job done; whether it’s when you’re working within your team or outside your team. There will always be people you don’t like and learning how to deal with them is important. Also, keeping an open mind with things like ideas is vital when working with big projects. Persistence and restlessness, a passion to learn and do more, will help you create more innovative projects and advance more in the tech industry. Also, it was really fun and useful when Martha taught us some verbal self-defense skills.

                            Say yes to offers or opportunities that you may or may not feel comfortable in doing because in the end the experience will be worth it and it may even be a chance to learn something new and develop new skills. Very male Very pale. It’s okay to be scared. Fake it. Find your inner Kanye be confident and proud of your work. “it’s not bragging if you can back it up.” – Muhammad Ali. “Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.” – Maya Angelou. Overall, I learned just to be more confident, proud of your work, and to pursue something you have a passion for.
